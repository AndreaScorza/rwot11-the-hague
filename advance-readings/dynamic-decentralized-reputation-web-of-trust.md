### Web of Trust, As We Know It, Is Flawed

The core concept behind the [original Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) is based on actors (through cryptographic keys) vouching for each other. Quoting directly from Phil Zimmerman (emphasis mine):

> **As time goes on**, you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to designate as trusted introducers. Everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers. And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a collection of certifying signatures from other people, **with the expectation that anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures**. This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web of confidence for all public keys.

The problem with such proof-of-authority systems is that often model for **reputation to go in only one direction: *upwards***. Actors who have been around longer gather more "stamps" of approval. This can be an issue because:

1. 

Secondly, even if such systems allow for revoking these accumulated approvals, the problem still remains that they are often only
