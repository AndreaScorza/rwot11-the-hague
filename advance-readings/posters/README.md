Please upload your posters for Monday's poster night here by submitting a PR. If a poster has been autogenerated for you, just replace it with your own poster.

Please match the filename of your advance reading, but add a `-poster` suffix. For example `my-great-idea.md` would become `my-great-idea-poster.md`.

**Format:**
* PDF
* CMYK color
* A3 size (that's 297 x 420 mm or 11.7 x 16.5 in)

Your poster will be printed out for you by the people at the venue!
