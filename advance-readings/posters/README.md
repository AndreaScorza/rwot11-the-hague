Please upload your posters for Monday's poster night here by submitting a PR. If a poster has been autogenerated for you, just replace it with your own poster.

Please match the filename of your advance reading, but add a `-poster` suffix. For example `my-great-idea.md` would become `my-great-idea-poster.md`.

**Format:**
* PDF
* CMYK color
* A3 size (that's 297 x 420 mm or 11.7 x 16.5 in)

Expect that things will get darker when printed, so be careful of backgrounds!

You can create posters by hand in programs like Photoshop or Illustrator, or you can output a slideshow as a PDF, then reread the PDF into a program such as Preview on the Mac that will output X-up prints, and print a 9-up version of your PDF as a new PDF. The [CSR poster](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/posters/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr-poster.pdf) was created in Illustrator and the [Elision Poster](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/posters/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents-poster.pdf) was created as a 9-slide slideshow, printed 9-up, as examples.

Your poster will be printed out for you by the people at the venue!
